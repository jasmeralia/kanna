/**
 * Widgets in the right sidebar's column.
 *
 * Styled after the left sidebar: the same rounded, bordered card, and a header
 * that reads like its section headers (muted label, icon, trailing count), so
 * the two sidebars look like one app rather than a chat UI with a dev panel
 * bolted on.
 *
 * A widget is one or more sections in a card. Most widgets are one section
 * (WidgetCard); a widget can stack several in one WidgetGroup, each with its
 * own disclosure, split by a divider.
 *
 * The grammar every widget follows, so the column reads as one design:
 * - Count: a bare number ("5"). A subset of it is "N of M" ("3 of 5"). A state
 *   word goes after the number ("3 of 5 running", "2 unpushed").
 * - Running: the red `text-logo` spinner the left sidebar shows for a busy
 *   chat. Done is `text-success`, failed is `text-destructive`.
 * - Bodies are built from the parts in parts.tsx (Strip, List of Rows,
 *   Static, Footer), never from ad hoc padding, dividers or hover classes.
 *   Rows sit 1px apart and no more, so a highlight never visibly drops out.
 * - Row actions: a context menu on the row, opened from a kebab for
 *   pointers that can't right-click (WidgetRow's `menu`).
 * - Disclosures start open when they hold a few rows and closed when they
 *   hold many (defaultWidgetExpanded). Once toggled, they remember it per project.
 * - Status changes (spinner to check, a label that swaps) cross-fade through
 *   SwapIn. Nothing else in the column animates except cards entering and
 *   leaving (WidgetPresence): the column is opened too often for more.
